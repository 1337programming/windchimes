Note: This project currently requires a weird-ass setup with a local Angular source clone to build (see `tsconfig.json` and `webpack.config.js`):

1. Clone git@github.com:teropa/angular.git to a sibling directory
2. Checkout branch `lol`
3. `npm install` and `gulp build.js.cjs` there.

This situation will resolve itself as soon as animation support if finished and gets
merged into Angular 2.
